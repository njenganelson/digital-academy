Building Websites With HTML, CSS

Getting Started Tools

The following tools help make easier to work with sample code.

git: A tool for managing source code
Visual Studio Code: A source code editor

Setup
If you installed git you can clone the code to your machine, or download a ZIP of all the files directly.

Download the ZIP from this location, or run the following git command to clone the files to your machine:

git clone <https://github.com/craigshoemaker/html-css-javascript-getting-started>
Once the files are on your machine, open the html-css-javascript-getting-started folder in Visual Studio Code.

With the files open in Visual Studio Code, press the Go Live button at the bottom of the window to launch the files with Live Server.
